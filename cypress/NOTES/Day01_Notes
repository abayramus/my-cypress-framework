Cypress Day 03 
========
Folder Structure:
------------------
1. Fixture: Used to create constant test data
-url, email, username, password,..
-This is like creating static variables in JAVA
---------------------
2. integration:
-This folder is used to create the test cases
-similar to java folder in selenium
-By default this folder has some test cases
-We can delete those test case and write our own
-in this folder we can create our own folders and test classes
----------------------------------
3. plug ins:
-By default, this has index.js
-We can add our own plugins
	-browser options
	-accepting browser certificates ...
----------------------
4. support:
-This is used to create custom methods, utility classes,...
-When we add any costom methods in support folder, they will be visible in the entire framework automatically
---------------
5. node_modules:
-This has all packages and required npm(node package manager)
-This is similar to maven dependencies/plugins
-----------
6. cypress.json
-This is used to override cypress custom behaviours
-Adding global variables
-Add this in cypress.json file to override subdomain security

{
    "chromeWebSecurity": false
}
-----------
7. package-lock.json
-After npm commends, this file will be generated
-This is specific file based on the npm packages
(project specific informations)
-In our case, this package has all cypress specific informarion
------------
8.package.json
-This file has basic general configirations
-such as name, description, devDependencies
--------------
Note:
Cypress runs inside the browser unlike the other automation tool
For example, selenium need WrebDriver and it runs outside of the browser
------------------------------
-Cypress used only javascript/jquery
-Cypress can run on chrome, firefox, edge, electron(default cypress browser)
-It is esy to to run headless test execution
-It is easy to get screenshot and videos with cypress.
-It is easy to debug the cypress test cases.
-Cypress helps us to find the locators easily

-------------------------------
-Cypress waits 4 seconds dynamically by defults. 
-4 seconds wait will be applied when needed.
-We can overwrite this behavior
